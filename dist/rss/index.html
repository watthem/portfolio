Man, I can't.  OK, I have an excuse because of the sleep depredation, but I do remember this part:</p><p>I did this a majority project with one hand.</p><p>A lot of the initial layout and composition was done by manually adapting a very rough SVG draft (I mean... rough) to an HTML struct.</p><p>Then... I did what nature does.  I bent shape into a light and... voila.<br>How did I bend it exactly? Well... a lot of <code>&lt;</code> <code>^</code> <code>&gt;</code> and <code>+-</code> keys.</p><p>Through a combination of absolute positioning, well-timed <code>%</code>, and several view-port metrics, I remember being very excited at some of the responsive behaviors I was able to obtain out of this little <code>.toy</code> object. </p><p>There's definitely some issues when used on other browsers, and I fixed a few through a few more burbs and knee bounces.  Overall, there's not a lot of practical uses for something like this, but I feel I learned a lot about the ways you can re-shape essential CSS elements, in addition to exploring newer browser APIs.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[[Technical Conent] NinjaScript Best Practices]]></title><description><![CDATA[<h2></h2>]]></description><link>http://localhost:2368/ninjascript-best-practices/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5c61e3e1d899247ad0f7be0c</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Matthew Hendricks]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 12 Feb 2019 06:03:20 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2></h2>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[[Technical Content] "What's New in NinjaTrader 8"]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>My first assignment as a Jr. Product Manger for NinjaTrader was to compile, review, and publish technical copy for marketing teams to tease content to users eagerly waiting the milestone release of NinjaTrader version 8.</p><p><a href="https://ninjatrader.com/support/helpGuides/nt8/en-us/whats_new.htm">https://ninjatrader.com/support/helpGuides/nt8/en-us/whats_new.htm</a></p>]]></description><link>http://localhost:2368/ninjatrader-2/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5c61d9b70d49cd4a4541df25</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Matthew Hendricks]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 11 Feb 2019 20:25:27 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My first assignment as a Jr. Product Manger for NinjaTrader was to compile, review, and publish technical copy for marketing teams to tease content to users eagerly waiting the milestone release of NinjaTrader version 8.</p><p><a href="https://ninjatrader.com/support/helpGuides/nt8/en-us/whats_new.htm">https://ninjatrader.com/support/helpGuides/nt8/en-us/whats_new.htm</a></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[[Technical Content/Web Design] NinjaTrader 8 Content Help Guide and Development]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>As an individual contributor, I worked late nights updating the HTML, CSS, Javascript in our "Help + Manual" software used to maintain software operations and API content between major software releases.
