My time in studying programming best practices has helped me develop advanced skills I've used to enjoy refactoring code â€“ and even wrestled with object orientated programming problems of my own making â€“ overall, my experience has made me an expert in the matter <strong>high-performance software systems</strong>, <strong>web browsers</strong>, &amp; <strong>computer networking</strong>.</p><p>I've found common ideas that help build on my success and have honed my abilities to cater to technical businesses needs. In that time have always used my writing as a force to help me realize my thoughts, I've made it my goal to minimize technical debt for business and consumers.</p><h3 id="i-currently-live-in-seattle-washington-as-a-freelance-writer">I currently live in Seattle, Washington as a freelance writer</h3><p>Enjoying life with my wife and 2-year-old son</p>  <div>
