id="confluence">Confluence</h3><p>In my time managing support and product teams, Atlassian products came up everywhere you turn.  Even though I'd first been interested in Atlassian for their issue tracking took JIRA, I was pleasantly surprised when I discovered <strong>Confluence – </strong>which you can think of as a more pleasant looking Wiki – it doubles as a very incredible knowledge and collaboration tool that rivals Google Docs and also integrates with many common services (not to mention a whole ecosystem of add-ons) .  When I took to starting my consulting services, I instantly knew that I was going to be using Confluence to help organize and plan my content. </p><h3 id="grammarly">Grammarly</h3><p>I used to shy away from tools that claimed to be grammar-aware but blown away by <a href="http://localhost:2500/untitled/www.grammarly.com">Grammarly</a>, especially when it comes to its simple double-click synonyms and vocabulary enhancements.</p><p>Whether it's working on those quick pre-coffee emails or double-checking comments in source code – it seems I've slowly found a way to work Grammarly into all of my projects.  </p><p>Without overlooking their Chrome extension and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grammarly.android.keyboard&amp;hl=en_US">Mobile Keyboard</a>  –  their web app is simple enough to keep as an open tab and has an intuitive, minimalist UI for sorting documents.  </p><h3 id="ghost-blog-engine">Ghost blog engine</h3><p> I'm using Ghost to publish this portfolio/site, and also use it host blog.thoughtaboutsolutions.com content</p><p>I stumbled my way around WordPress just enough to get frustrated with it – <a href="https://ghost.org">Ghost</a> was a refreshing change and have found it's JavaScript/Handlebars layout functions much more comfortable than brushing off the old php books.</p><h3 id="jira-trello">Jira/Trello</h3><p>I used to shift back and forth between two, so I was excited to see purchase Trello.  Since then entirely switched to JIRA Core for all of my business projects – JIRA is no longer just for software and IT teams, you can use JIRA to drive billing processes, create sales hooks, and even use it as a fully-fledged customer portal with knowledge base and support contact forms.</p><p></p><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Technical Consultations]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>I am a writer, but I also have over 10-years experience managing

intended to write this – when I set out to create my portfolio, I knew that I would be eventually hosting it on Github.io, but didn't stop to think how I'd convert my data from Ghost to static HTML files to host on that domain.  After all, Ghost uses a local database to store its content.</p><p>I found a helpful <a href="https://zzamboni.org/post/hosting-a-ghost-blog-in-github/">blogpost that walked me through the solution</a>, but  after I had to go back and retrace my steps, I thought more attention could be given to the solution.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>:  I am assuming you already know what Ghost is, and that you already have Ghost installed, and content running developmentally on your <code>localhost</code>.  If not, check out the original <a href="https://zzamboni.org/post/hosting-a-ghost-blog-in-github/">post</a> that inspired my post.</p><p>It seems there are a few npm utilities out (Buster) that can help convert your ghost content to be statically linked pages, but as pointed out in original blogpost, most systems already have a command installed that can be used. If you simply need a way to get your Ghost content hosted statically, then you just need to consider <code>wget</code> to download your files locally:</p><p>wget -r -nH -P dist -E -T 2 -np -k <a href="http://localhost:2368/">http://localhost:2368/</a></p>
<p>Running this command will download a static copy of each file linked in the URL and can be parameterized to ensure all your content and inks work the same as hosted at the development version.</p><p>I wanna break down this command:</p><h3 id="wget">wget</h3><p>wget a standard utility for fetching web site data from the command line.  If you're using mac or linux, you probably have this installed by default.  If not, it's pretty straightforward to ... uh, get.</p><h3 id="-r">-r</h3><p>We're instructing <code>wget</code> to download files in a recursive manner – meaning wget will first requested the primary document at the given URL (http://localhost:2368/), and then download each documents linked from that document (up to five levels – which can be modified using the <code>-l</code> option).  This makes sure we get all the referenced libaries, style sheets, important children pages linked in the site.</p><h3 id="-nh">-nH </h3><p>Disables host-prefixed file names.</p><h3 id="-p">-P</h3><p>Instructs wget to include all files, including images so the desired document looks just like you published</p><h3 id="dist">dist</h3><p>The folder you wish to output the contents to</p><h3 id="-e">-E<br></h3><p>Adds HTML/CSS extension to the destination file type<br></p><h3 id="-t-2">-T 2 <br></h3><p>Retry the request up to 2 times (in case of errors)</p><h3 id="-np">-np </h3><p><br>Ensures that directories above the parent page are not retrieved</p><h3 id="-k">-k </h3><p><br>Ensures links are converted to local files </p><h3 id="http-localhost-2368-"><br><a href="http://localhost:2368/">http://localhost:2368/</a></h3><p>The default location of your ghost install (run <code>ghost start</code> if not available or check your ghost directory <code>config.development.json</code> for port value) </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[[CSS] Google Inbox Sun and Clouds]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>My favorite part of my day is marking my Google Inbox items as done.

I've spent quite a bit of time in the last few months in a dark room while I swaddle / shush / swing him to sleep.

Man, I can't.  OK, I have an excuse because of the sleep depredation, but I do remember this part:</p><p>I did this a majority project with one hand.</p><p>A lot of the initial layout and composition was done by manually adapting a very rough SVG draft (I mean... rough) to an HTML struct.</p><p>Then... I did what nature does.  I bent shape into a light and... voila.<br>How did I bend it exactly? Well... a lot of <code>&lt;</code> <code>^</code> <code>&gt;</code> and <code>+-</code> keys.</p><p>Through a combination of absolute positioning, well-timed <code>%</code>, and several view-port metrics, I remember being very excited at some of the responsive behaviors I was able to obtain out of this little <code>.toy</code> object. </p><p>There's definitely some issues when used on other browsers, and I fixed a few through a few more burbs and knee bounces.  Overall, there's not a lot of practical uses for something like this, but I feel I learned a lot about the ways you can re-shape essential CSS elements, in addition to exploring newer browser APIs.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
