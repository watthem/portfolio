title: Compatibility of your existing NetGauge OoklaServer Daemon â€“ Ookla Speedtest Custom
company: Ookla (Speedtest.net)
Status: Ready
published: true
description: To ensure network software was compatible with the latest JavaScript client technology, Ookla's database of licensed vendors needed to update the server-side component hosted in their network. Since it was not always possible to remotely verify each instance due to vendor side networking security limitations, we provided a tutorial to help manually check the version on the server.
