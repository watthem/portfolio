description: One of the primary goals of the new NinjaTrader 8 help guide was to make it media-rich and user-friendly. Where possible, we tried to include videos to help users understand software operation concepts and tutorials. I was involved with planning and writing many of the scripts that were used in our collection of videos, and was also responsible for updating the help guide with the video content as each new video was released. This page shows an overview list of all the videos available through the help guide.
Subject Matter: Day trading, NinjaTrader
Built With: Help+Manual, JIRA, Youtube.com
