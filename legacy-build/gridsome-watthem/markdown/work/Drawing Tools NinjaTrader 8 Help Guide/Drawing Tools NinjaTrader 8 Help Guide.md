description: When looking at technical financial data, it's common to need to annotate certain data points on the chart that can be saved and shared for others - we took this approach one step further and extended access to our class of "Drawing Tools" to allow users to develop unique drawing tools, building off the concepts we designed to implement the standard set of tools that came with the platform. This was the API Reference that enabled a developer to start using this group of methods and types.
Subject Matter: .NET, C#, DirectX
Built With: Confluence, Help+Manual, JIRA
