description: Ookla's Speedtest Custom was hosted on speedtestcustom.com as a service to help licensed vendors to configure and eventually reference through an HTML5 iframe on their website. This required every test instance to define a custom subdomain that worked as their licensed Test URL. As this detail was a major change for users used to the self-hosted legacy technology, it required a guide to help vendors understand the purpose of the major step in setting up their process.
