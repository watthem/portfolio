> See my [examples of my work](/work/).

My name is Matthew Hendricks, and I've been employed for 13 years in the financial and technical services industry.

<a class="link-button" href="/resume/"><button>View résumé</button></a>

Traditionally, what I've done is help connect people to big industries. What I'm looking do today is help connect people to themselves -- so they can become their own industries.

I believe people are capable of being their own:

- Banks and brokerages
- Data and services providers
- Advertisement and publishing agencies
- And much more than they are today

I have worked remotely with both smaller start-ups and independent consulting gigs for larger enterprises. I've also had the good fortune of working for giant technology products:

- **Ookla Speedtest Custom** - the white-label version of [Speedtest.net](http://speedtest.net/)
- **NinjaTrader 8 help guide** - I contributed to many of innovative trading platform's [Help Guides and Connection Guides](<[www.ninjatrader.com](https://ninjatrader.com/Help-Connection-Guides)>)
- **Microsoft Core M365 docs team** - (shortly until Covid-19)

I am proud of the accomplishments I have had on the teams I've been a part of and I am considered an influence of high quality and new standards.
