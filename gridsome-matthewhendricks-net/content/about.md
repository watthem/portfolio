## Fintech Writer and Product Manager

> See my [examples of my work](/work/).

My name is Matthew Hendricks, and I've been employed for 13 years in the financial and technical services industry.

- <a class="link-button" href="/resume/"><button>My résumé</button></a>

Traditionally, what I've done is help connect people to big industries. What I'm looking do today is help connect people to themselves -- so they can become their own industries.

I believe people are capable of being their own:

- Banks and brokerages
- Data and services providers
- Advertisement and publishing agencies
- And much more than they are today

I have worked remotely with both smaller start-ups and independent consulting gigs for larger enterprises. I've also had the good fortune of working for technology giants:

- **Ookla** - (the outstanding cats behind [Speedtest.net](http://speedtest.net/))
- **Microsoft** - (shortly until Covid-19)

I am proud of the accomplishments I have had on the teams I've been a part of and I am considered an influence of high quality and new standards.

## I am currently Living in Seattle, WA

- Experienced as a technical writer, product manager, technical services manager.
