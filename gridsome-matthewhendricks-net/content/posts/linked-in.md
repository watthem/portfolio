## Why I’m not on LinkedIn

I was a daily LinkedIn users for a number of years. Despite the postive connections and interactions, I had to take a break.

In December 2020, I took a hard look at my ROI over time. And it hit me - all that time - LinkedIn had provided me $0 in successful opportunities.

Maybe I didn’t use it correctly, or perhaps I didn’t have time. But I know I walked away from LinkedIn feeling bad about myself ([you know the type of content](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/why-are-these-posts-taking-over-your-linkedin-feed-because)). And the jobs that used to reach me on that platform [made me feel even worse](https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/10/linkedin-sucks/).

I have plenty of business sense and knowledge to drop things that aren’t working out.

The answer to a poor diet isn’t over-eating, just to “get my money’s worth”.

So I’m looking for healthier alternatives instead.
