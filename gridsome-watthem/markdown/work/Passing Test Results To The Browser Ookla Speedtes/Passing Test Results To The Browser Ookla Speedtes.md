title: Passing Test Results To The Browser â€“ Ookla Speedtest Custom
Company: Ookla (Speedtest.net)
Status: Ready
Stub: Ookla's Speedtest Custom provided automatic storage of test results hosted in the online reporting dashboard for each license, however sometimes users needed to capture more information than was provided by the licensed features. To help with customer use cases, the Javascript client leveraged the browser's Window.postMessage() method to safely enable cross-origin communication between the client's test instance and their self-hosted desired database. 
Subject Matter: HTML5, JavaScript, XHR
