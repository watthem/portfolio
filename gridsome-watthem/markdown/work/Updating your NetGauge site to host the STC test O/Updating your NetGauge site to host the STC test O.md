title: Updating your NetGauge site to host the STC test â€“ Ookla Speedtest Custom
Company: Ookla (Speedtest.net)
Status: Ready
Stub: The client-side technology used to execute and host a test on a customer's website was completely rehauled and required a different approach to get similar results on the client's site. We worked to make this process as simple as possible for users who were used to a more complicated approach to hosting the test engine.
