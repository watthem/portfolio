title: NinjaScript Best Practices - NinjaTrader 8 Help Guide
Company: NinjaTrader LLC
Status: Ready
Stub: Over 6-years of work supporting C# developers and the end-users of custom scripts, I accumulated quite a bit of tribal knowledge that was not always clear to end-users how to implement custom scripts to ensure the best performance and maintenance for their users. One of my last assignments for NinjaTrader was compiling a list of common scenarios, gotchas, and workarounds to help optimize the code that was distributed through the ecosystem.
Subject Matter: .NET, C#, NinjaScript, SharpDX (DirectX), WPF
Built With: Confluence, Help+Manual, JIRA
