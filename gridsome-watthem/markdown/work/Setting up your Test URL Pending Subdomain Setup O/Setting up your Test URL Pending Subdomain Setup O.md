title: Setting up your Test URL (Pending Subdomain Setup) â€“ Ookla Speedtest Custom
Company: Ookla (Speedtest.net)
Status: Ready
Stub: Ookla's Speedtest Custom was hosted on http://speedtestcustom.com as a service to help licensed vendors to configure and eventually reference through an HTML5 iframe on their website. This required every test instance to define a custom subdomain that worked as their licensed Test URL. As this detail was a major change for users used to the self-hosted legacy technology, it required a guide to help vendors understand the purpose for the major step in setting up their process.
