title: Video Library - NinjaTrader 8 Help Guide
Company: NinjaTrader LLC
Status: Ready
Stub: One of the primary goals of the new NinjaTrader 8 help guide was to make it as media-rich and user friendly as possible. Where possible, we tried to include videos to help users understand software operation concepts and tutorials. I was involved with planning and writing many of the scripts that were used in our collection of videos, and was also responsible for updating the help guide with the video content as each new video was released. This page shows an overview list of all the videos available through the help guide.
Subject Matter: Day trading, NinjaTrader
Built With: Help+Manual, JIRA, Youtube.com
