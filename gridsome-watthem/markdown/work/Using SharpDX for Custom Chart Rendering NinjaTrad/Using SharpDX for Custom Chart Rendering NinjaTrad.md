title: Using SharpDX for Custom Chart Rendering - NinjaTrader 8 Help Guide
Company: NinjaTrader LLC
Status: Ready
Stub: NinjaTrader 8 Charts used a .NET Library called SharpDX that worked with the native Microsoft DirectX API. This was a major overhaul from the previously used GDI namespace and in efforts to help provide better for support for custom chart rendering, I was tasked with designing a tutorial to help users understand the new information that came along with the updated requirements.
Subject Matter: SharpDX (DirectX)
Built With: Confluence, Help+Manual, JIRA
