title: Compatibility of your existing NetGauge OoklaServer Daemon â€“ Ookla Speedtest Custom
Company: Ookla (Speedtest.net)
Status: Ready
Stub: To ensure network software was compatible with the latest JavaScript client technology, it was important that Ookla's database of licensed vendors update the server-side component hosted in their network. Since it was not always possible to remotely verify each instance due to vendor side networking security limitations, we provided a tutorial to help manually check the version on the server.
Subject Matter: C++, High-performance Browser Networking, SSL Certificates
Technology Used: ZenDesk
