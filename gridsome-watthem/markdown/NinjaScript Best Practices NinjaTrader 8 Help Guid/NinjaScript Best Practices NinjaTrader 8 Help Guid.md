Stub: Over 6-years of work supporting C# developers and the end-users of custom scripts, I accumulated quite a bit of tribal knowledge that was not always clear to end-users how to implement to ensure best performance and maintenance of their custom scripts.. One of my last assignments for NinjaTrader was compiling a list of common scenarios, gotchas, and workarounds to help optimize the code that was distributed through the ecosystem.
Subject Matter: .NET, C#, NinjaScript, SharpDX (DirectX), WPF
Technology Used: Confluence, Help+Manual, JIRA
