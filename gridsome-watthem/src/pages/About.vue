        My name is Matthew Hendricks and I was raised on the
        <a

        >short-grass Nebraska prairies</a>.

      <p>That was pretty much my backyard.</p>
      <p>Although, I spent more time wrestling with computers than I ever spent chasing oxen.</p>
      <p>
        My youth is where my early career in technology began – while I enjoyed working on my PC, modding old computer games, &amp; eventually writing
        <strong>HTML/CSS</strong>for local Myspace music profiles and LiveJournal/Xanga users – I cut my teeth crawling through businesses helping my dad install Layer 1 &amp; Layer 2 Ethernet services (school computer networks, hospitals nurse calls, etc) where where I learned the value of computer networks – and the importance of considering every data link in transaction with regards to latency.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since then, I've gone on to learn to program with
        <strong>Javascript</strong>, &nbsp;
        <strong>Ruby/Rails</strong>, and
        <strong>C#/.NET</strong> &nbsp;to help me tackle technical problems in my journey – but my passion has always been for old-fashion writing and problem-solving.

        As a former product manager for
        <strong>
          <a href="www.ninjatrader.com">NinjaTrader LLC</a>
        </strong>, technical services manager at
        <strong>
          <a href="www.ookla.com">Ookla</a>
        </strong>, and eventual department manager for
        <a
          href="www.linkedin.com/in/mscohendricks"
        >each company I've worked for</a>, I am a well-rounded
        <strong>technical lead</strong> who has written professional content for software products.

        My work often required digging deep into code and operating out of comfort zones. My time in studying programming best practices has helped me develop advanced skills I've used to enjoy refactoring code – and even wrestled with object orientated programming problems of my own making – overall, my experience has made me an expert in the matter
        <strong>high-performance software systems</strong>,
        <strong>web browsers</strong>, &amp;
        <strong>computer networking</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>I've found common ideas that help build on my success and have honed my abilities to cater to technical businesses needs. In that time have always used my writing as a force to help me realize my thoughts, I've made it my goal to minimize technical debt for business and consumers.</p>
