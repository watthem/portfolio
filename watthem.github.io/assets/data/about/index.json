Remember the Oregon Trail game? That was pretty much my backyard.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"http://watthem.github.io/content/images/2019/06/ot.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Although, I spent more time wrestling with computers than I ever spent chasing oxen.</p><h3 id=\"this-is-where-my-early-career-in-technology-first-started-\">This is where my early career in technology first started.</h3><p>I enjoyed doing work on my computer modifying old computer games. When we got our first 28k internet connection, the web was in its early years. As I grew up in chat rooms and music message boards, naturally, I began designing templates for Myspace music profiles for fun. This provided me an introduction to computer languages.</p><p>On the weekends, I cut my teeth with my dad's business climbing and out of ceiling tiles and through crawlspaces helping install networking services for local businesses. This is where I learned the value of high-performance computer networks (and the importance of considering every data link in transaction latency). </p><h3 id=\"my-early-experiences-would-go-on-to-help-me-in-technical-services-for-internet-startups-in-the-financial-tech-and-telecom-industry-\">My early experiences would go on to help me in technical services for internet startups in the financial tech and telecom industry.</h3><p>As a former Product Manager for <a href=\"https://www.ninjatrader.com\">NinjaTrader LLC</a> and Technical Services Manager at <a href=\"https://www.ookla.com\">Ookla (Speedtest.net)</a>, I am a well-rounded <strong>technical lead </strong>who has written professional content for software products and technical procedures.</p><p>To help me tackle technical problems in my journey, my hands-on documentation approach has taught me to program with <strong>JavaScript</strong>, Â <strong>Ruby/Rails</strong>, and <strong>C#/.NET</strong>. But my passion has always been for old-fashion writing and problem-solving - my work often requires digging deep into code and operating out of comfort zones.</p><p>My recent time studying programming best practices has helped me develop advanced skills I use every day. From refactoring code, documenting coding solutions, and studying new frameworks, my experiences have made me an expert in technical content management and high-performance computer networking concepts.</p><p>In all of my lessons, I've found common ideas that help build on my success and I draw on evidence from my life that provides a path to sharpen my abilities to cater to technical business needs.</p><p>I have always used my writing as a force to help me realize my thoughts and I've made it my goal to minimize technical debt for business and consumers.</p><h3 id=\"i-currently-live-in-seattle-washington-as-a-technical-writing-consulting-and-freelance-writer-\">I currently live in Seattle, Washington as a technical writing consulting and freelance writer.</h3><p><br></p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><video width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" autoplay=\"\" loop=\"\" muted=\"\" auto=\"\">\n      <source src=\"http://watthem.github.io/seattle.mp4\">\n  </video><!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Enjoying city life with my wife and 2-year-old son.</p>"}},"context":{}}
