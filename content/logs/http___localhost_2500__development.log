And I knew that I wanted to keep the same awesome writing environment I'd enjoyed with <a href=\"https://medium.com\">Medium.com</a> – so using Ghost to management my content was an obvious choice for me.</p><p>But I didn't stop to think about how I'd convert my data from Ghost posts to utilize the free static site hosting service on my GitHub page. After all, Ghost uses a local MySQL database to store its content and must be deployed by a managed web service running Node.js.  But GitHub pages isn't a fully robust virtual server - it's a simple web service that can only deploy posts and pages as static HTML files.</p><h3 id=\"so-my-options-were-a-bit-restricted-my-own-choosiness\">So my options were a bit restricted my own choosiness</h3><p>First of all, I couldn't Host the Ghost engine the official <a href=\"https://ghost.org/pricing/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Ghost(Pro)</strong></a> managed service because I need the content to be built as static files to use for GitHub Pages.</p><p>The first time I set up a Ghost site, I simply configured a LAMP droplet at DigtialOcean and administrator the deployments through my virtual server.  This worked well for a while, but hosting costs became a huge factor. Especially during earlier development and administration; each update to your settings or content is going to use resources on the virtual server and this starts to add up over time.  And even then, similar to GhostPro, I still need to <em>somehow </em>build the files to HTML.  At this point, there seemed to be no advantage to hosting the engine using a fully fledged web server.</p><p>So there I thought was only one option to choose:</p><ul><li>Host the Ghost engine locally and convert the files to static HTML  </li></ul><p>This was an attractive option, but I became a little paralyzed as I looked at my static generation options. Jekyll, Gatsby, Hugo, Gridsome – ugh, how much skin does this cat have?</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1525538182201-02cd1909effb?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=1080&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Repetition, playfulness, pop art, these are a few of my favorite things.\"><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@joshstyle?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit\">JOSHUA COLEMAN</a> / <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>I searched a little about how other's tackle this problem and while Ghost API is very well documented and easy for me to use with other projects, I felt it was a bit overkill to spend time setting up a static site framework to host a handful of markdown files that were already built as a web page in my local environment anyway!</p><p>So, deciding to stick solely with Ghost, I also came across out-of-date utilities that supposedly helped with this problem by downloading the pages to simply throw on a web server, which seemed like both a straightforward and a puzzling solution to me – why do I need <em>another</em> utility?  The web pages already work in my browser locally.  And my experience doing QA/Support for public ISPs and hosting providers made me comfortable using the standard <strong>wget</strong> utility to download web pages, files, and images from the web using the command line, and is essentially what these other utilities were doing.  </p><p>Through late-night trial and error with <strong>wget</strong>, I was able to easily build and commit the entire website you see today.  And then after I had to go back and retrace my steps, I thought more attention could be given to the solution, so here I am writing to you.</p><h2 id=\"setting-up-ghost-local\">Setting Up Ghost Local</h2><p>I'll keep this part brief, but should be enough to help get ghost running local for you to play if you've never used it before.</p><h3 id=\"1-install-node-js\">1.

And I knew that I wanted to keep the same awesome writing environment I'd enjoyed with <a href=\"https://medium.com\">Medium.com</a> – so using Ghost to management my content was an obvious choice for me.</p><p>But I didn't stop to think about how I'd convert my data from Ghost posts to utilize the free static site hosting service on my GitHub page. After all, Ghost uses a local MySQL database to store its content and must be deployed by a managed web service running Node.js.  But GitHub pages isn't a fully robust virtual server - it's a simple web service that can only deploy posts and pages as static HTML files.</p><h3 id=\"so-my-options-were-a-bit-restricted-my-own-choosiness\">So my options were a bit restricted my own choosiness</h3><p>First of all, I couldn't Host the Ghost engine the official <a href=\"https://ghost.org/pricing/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Ghost(Pro)</strong></a> managed service because I need the content to be built as static files to use for GitHub Pages.</p><p>The first time I set up a Ghost site, I simply configured a LAMP droplet at DigtialOcean and administrator the deployments through my virtual server.  This worked well for a while, but hosting costs became a huge factor. Especially during earlier development and administration; each update to your settings or content is going to use resources on the virtual server and this starts to add up over time.  And even then, similar to GhostPro, I still need to <em>somehow </em>build the files to HTML.  At this point, there seemed to be no advantage to hosting the engine using a fully fledged web server.</p><p>So there I thought was only one option to choose:</p><ul><li>Host the Ghost engine locally and convert the files to static HTML  </li></ul><p>This was an attractive option, but I became a little paralyzed as I looked at my static generation options. Jekyll, Gatsby, Hugo, Gridsome – ugh, how much skin does this cat have?</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1525538182201-02cd1909effb?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=1080&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Repetition, playfulness, pop art, these are a few of my favorite things.\"><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@joshstyle?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit\">JOSHUA COLEMAN</a> / <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>I searched a little about how other's tackle this problem and while Ghost API is very well documented and easy for me to use with other projects, I felt it was a bit overkill to spend time setting up a static site framework to host a handful of markdown files that were already built as a web page in my local environment anyway!</p><p>So, deciding to stick solely with Ghost, I also came across out-of-date utilities that supposedly helped with this problem by downloading the pages to simply throw on a web server, which seemed like both a straightforward and a puzzling solution to me – why do I need <em>another</em> utility?  The web pages already work in my browser locally.  And my experience doing QA/Support for public ISPs and hosting providers made me comfortable using the standard <strong>wget</strong> utility to download web pages, files, and images from the web using the command line, and is essentially what these other utilities were doing.  </p><p>Through late-night trial and error with <strong>wget</strong>, I was able to easily build and commit the entire website you see today.  And then after I had to go back and retrace my steps, I thought more attention could be given to the solution, so here I am writing to you.</p><h2 id=\"setting-up-ghost-local\">Setting Up Ghost Local</h2><p>I'll keep this part brief, but should be enough to help get ghost running local for you to play if you've never used it before.</p><h3 id=\"1-install-node-js\">1.

– </strong>which you can think of as a more pleasant looking Wiki – it doubles as a very incredible knowledge and collaboration tool that rivals Google Docs and also integrates with many common services (not to mention a whole ecosystem of add-ons) .  When I took to starting my consulting services, I instantly knew that I was going to be using Confluence to help organize and plan my content.

simple double-click synonyms and vocabulary enhancements.</p><p>Whether it's working on those quick pre-coffee emails or double-checking comments in source code – it seems I've slowly found a way to work Grammarly into all of my projects.  </p><p>Without overlooking their Chrome extension and <a

Trello.  Since then entirely switched to JIRA Core for all of my business projects – JIRA is no longer just for software and IT teams, you can use JIRA to drive billing processes, create sales hooks, and even use it as a fully-fledged customer portal with knowledge base and support contact

This demo also shows a bit of responsive web design using Flexbox, as well as the adoption of Material Design principles.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_VPBmZB\" src=\"https://codepen.io/watthem/embed/preview/VPBmZB?height=300&amp;slug-hash=VPBmZB&amp;default-tabs=js,result&amp;host=https://codepen.io\" title=\"Word Frequency VueJS\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"300\" allowtransparency=\"true\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width: 100%; overflow: hidden;\"></iframe></figure>","comment_id":"5c6d7f0e56bda46cb22537e5","feature_image":null,"featured":false,"page":false,"locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","published_at":{},"published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"authors":{"0":{"id":"1","name":"Matthew Hendricks","slug":"matthew","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":"{\"nightShift\":true}","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":"[\"upload-a-theme\",\"static-post\"]"}},"tags":{"0":{"id":"5c6d7f9356bda46cb22537ed","name":"VueJS","slug":"vuejs","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","parent":null},"1":{"id":"5c6d7f9356bda46cb22537ee","name":"JavaScript","slug":"javascript","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","parent":null},"2":{"id":"5c6d7f9356bda46cb22537ef","name":"Flexbox","slug":"flexbox","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","parent":null}},"author":{"id":"1","name":"Matthew Hendricks","slug":"matthew","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":"{\"nightShift\":true}","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":"[\"upload-a-theme\",\"static-post\"]"},"primary_author":{"id":"1","name":"Matthew Hendricks","slug":"matthew","profile_image":null,"cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"accessibility":"{\"nightShift\":true}","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"tour":"[\"upload-a-theme\",\"static-post\"]"},"primary_tag":{"id":"5c6d7f9356bda46cb22537ed","name":"VueJS","slug":"vuejs","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":{},"created_by":"1","updated_at":{},"updated_by":"1","parent":null},"url":"/word-frequency-vuejs/"},"_locals":{"version":"2.14.0","safeVersion":"2.14","relativeUrl":"/word-frequency-vuejs/amp/","apiVersion":"v0.1","secure":false,"context":{"0":"amp","1":"post"}}},"query":{}},"res":{"_headers":{"x-powered-by":"Express","cache-control":"public, max-age=0","content-type":"text/html; charset=utf-8","content-length":"15756","etag":"W/\"3d8c-lmS6ezPdbMNmBKHEtjbhZyyZLic\"","vary":"Accept-Encoding"},"statusCode":200,"responseTime":"23ms"},"msg":"","time":"2019-06-15T01:30:30.606Z","v":0}
