# Gridsome

`./gridsome-mscotthendricks` is a static site generator project powered by Gridsome and Vue that is configured to read local Markdown content from the local file system. See the [gridsome.config.js](https://github.com/mscotthendricks/portfolio/blob/master/gridsome-mscotthendricks/gridsome.config.js) for more information.

Content is built from local files in relative `gridsome-mscotthendricks\content` directory.

## Start gridsome in local development mode to make changes to layout.
