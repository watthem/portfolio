description: Over 6-years of work supporting C# developers and the end-users of custom scripts, I accumulated a nice collection of tribal knowledge. Sometimes, the solutions to common scenarios were not always clear to end-users how to implement custom scripts. To ensure the best performance and maintenance for their users, one of my last assignments for NinjaTrader was compiling a list of common scenarios, gotchas, and workarounds to help optimize the code distributed through the ecosystem.
subjects: [".NET-C#", "NinjaTrader", "DirectX"]
