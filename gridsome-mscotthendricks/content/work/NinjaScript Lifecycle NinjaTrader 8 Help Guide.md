description: NinjaTrader provided a custom classes of programming interfaces that were given low-level access to core software objects to make it easy to develop custom add-ons, yet were wrapped in abstract layers that were sometimes not so easy to understand in common debug scenarios. To help with the learning curve, I worked with the team of product managers and engineers to help ensure that 3rd party developers understood how each instance of their custom NinjaScript types would be expected to be handled by core NinjaTrader platform.
