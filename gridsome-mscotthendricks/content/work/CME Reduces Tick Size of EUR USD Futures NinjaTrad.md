title: CME Reduces Tick Size of EUR/USD Futures - NinjaTrader Blog
company: NinjaTrader LLC
Status: Ready
description: Between my time as a technical support lead and product manager, it was often my job to help catch wide-spread issues before they caused issues for the ecosystem of users. We often authored In Product Advisories that were also re-hosted on the NinjaTrader blog to assist in these scenarios. This is one example of the many advisories that I helped write and edit.
