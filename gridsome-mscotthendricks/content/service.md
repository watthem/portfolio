# Freelance Services and Technical Solutions

You need someone who understands the plan and the deliverable. Getting a comprehensive view of specialized work and cutting down useless processes is what I like to do best.

What I do almost every day (and what I can help you with doing):

1. [Technical Writing](/services/documentation) for internal and external audiences.
2. [Product and Project Management](/services/management) for software projects.
3. [Technical Solutions](/services/web) for the web.

As a disciplined technical writer, my core strength is in understanding how to use the entire team to manage subject-matter time efficiently. As a versatile product manager, I keep a bird's-eye view on all priorities that keep me transparent and flexible to make changes when needed.

_Follow the science_ - I’m ready to work with you using an empirical and development-focused mindset. Following evidence and research has taught me remarkable ways to build on human strengths that can be applied to work successfully on your project.

## **Questions**

### **How can you help me with my website?**

I specialize in website integrations and project-related planning, support, and documentation.

### **What is JAMStack?**

JAMStack stands for JavaScript, APIs, and Markdown and is a fresh approach for building websites. I have found this method useful since it makes it easy to update content.

### **Do you use XYZ framework?**

If you're looking for a technical document and support, I'd love to help! Shoot me an email and we can talk about your requirements.

As far as web solutions, I stay away from large frameworks and like to build lightweight websites that anyone can use and update.

### **What do you charge?**

Let's say, roughly `$50` an hour? But I prefer to charge based on project and milestone. We can talk this out.
