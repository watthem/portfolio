# About Matthew

![author](../src/assets/images/author.jpg)

## I'm a reliable, organized, and hard-working independent contractor.

See my [freelance services](/services) or [examples of my work](/work).

In a newly remote world, I am eager to exchange lessons, technologies, and methods to help you make better use of your time and focus on what needs to be completed.

Instead of doing it all, let's do what is impactful in a way that brings you success and peace of mind [by focusing on your energy](/how-to-plan-your-day-so-your-creativity-and-focus-will-flourish/).

I'm proud to have worked with smaller start-ups and independent consulting gigs. I've also had the good fortune of working for technology giants:

- **Ookla** - (the awesome cats behind [Speedtest.net](http://speedtest.net/))
- **Microsoft** - (until [Covid-19 ruined everything](/how-covid-19-ruined-everything/)

I am proud of the accomplishments that I have had on the teams that I've been a part of and considered to be an influence of high quality and new standards.

## I've been successful figuring out little ways to work on big problems.

Recently, I've learned to develop a new perspective on work which has helped me focus on what is actually working and how we can make those things better.

- Observing without judgment - pay attention to what keeps a job in the right direction.
- Documenting everything - refine what works well.
- Communicating empathetically - be specific, realistic, and prompt.
