> Looking for me on LinkedIn? Well, good news - it looks like you found me, anyway!

## Hi LinkedIn user

I assume you might be a recruiter or maybe a hiring manager. So I understand you have little time - you can skip [the philosophy](#why-im-not-on-linkedin).

### TL;DR

#### If you’re looking for my work history

- See my [resume](/resume/)

#### If you you’re looking for an example of my work

- See my [portfolio work](/work/)

#### If you need references

- Check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/watthem/) repo - people there can speak for my work.

#### If you want to get in touch

- [email me](mailto:mscotthendricks@gmail.com)

- [text me](tel:+12064465495)

- [schedule a call](/contact#schedule-a-call)

## Why I’m not on LinkedIn

I used LinkedIn daily - for years. Despite the fondness I felt for the connections and interactions I’ve had over time, I took a hard look at my ROI over time spent using LinkedIn. And it hit me - all that time - LinkedIn had provided me $0 in successful opportunities.

I have plenty of business sense and knowledge to drop things that aren’t working out.

Maybe I didn’t use it correctly, but perhaps I didn’t have time. But I know I walked away from LinkedIn feeling bad about myself ([you know the type of content](toxic-positive-content/)). And the jobs that used to reach me on that platform plainly made me feel even worse.

The answer to a poor diet isn’t over-eating, just to “get my money’s worth”.

So I’m looking for healthier alternatives instead.
