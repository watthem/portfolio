If we don’t have visions of kindness and generosity in our minds, it’s difficult to share these things with others.

Worry and doubt will surely strike at the worst of times. And it’s usually impossible to catch at the moment — it’s not until I’ve started acting and reacting that I realize that stress drives my behaviors or words.

[Meditation helps me with anxiety](https://medium.com/@thoughtabout/why-i-practice-time-in-35fed577418e). But it doesn’t mean I always need to break away and sit in a seated posture for 10 minutes at a time.

Adding an extra interval between our thoughts and our reactions is something we can evoke in the car, in a line in the grocery store, or between sips of a drink at a work meeting.

To remember:

- When there is a conflict in my mind, I bring the conflict to others.
- When there is resistance in my mind, I bring resistance to others.
- When there is sadness in my mind, I bring sadness to others.

At the same time:

- When there is space in my mind, I bring space to others.
- When there is hope in my mind, I bring hope to others.
- When there is kindness in mind, I bring kindness to others.

This may be a moderately straightforward principle, but I have to stop to ask myself: how much time do I spend practicing it? How often do I get lost in the acedia of conflict where I build pessimistic beliefs and talking to myself about things is not in spirit with reality?

## **Meditation has caught me daydreaming instead of staying persistent with growth.**

Reflection and stillness are not an exercise. It’s a condition of mind that we must practice like an exercise — yet the state is available at any moment.

To say “I’ve meditated for x-days” implies you’ve practiced your study for *y-interval* over x-_days_. But what is your streak of being attentive to your bias before you react?

## **How often are you genuinely integrating the practice into daily life?**

How many minutes, how many days, before it magically fixes whatever you are resisting each day?

Just to breathe and to notice the space between the inhale and exhale is meditation.

To do this every day is to be kind in the way you think, and consequently the way you talk about others — within yourself, and within your actions. Just by taking the time to see through how you feel, instead of how you indulge your feelings, is meditation.

Meditation is part of a system of the self, not an object of enlightenment, knowledge, or culture. It’s something that we can all work on strengthening so we may journey into a greater sense of self and awareness — and consequently bring hope, space, and kindness to others.
