#### Corona Virus: Parents Resource

> "With schools closed and children at home, anxiety is running high. We know parents are struggling to balance work, child care, self care all while keeping worries — both your children’s and you own — under control. You don’t have to do it alone. We’ve put together resources to help you stay safe, sane, and supported during this troubling time." — **[Child Mind Institute (childmind.org)](https://childmind.org/donate)**
