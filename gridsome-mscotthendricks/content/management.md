# **Product Management**

## **Use science and research to improve productive behavior.**

Explore research into neuroscience to help with managing, developing, and motivating technical managers, product managers, project coordinators, and other team members.

Getting positive results in any project comes down to a thoughtful strategy. This isn't about methodology, this is about the way your team works together.

A good product manager's josb is not only to create products users love to use, but to drive positive behavioral change.

## **Backed by neuroscience.**

My background in [product-based behaviorism](/services/management) and [interests in neuroscience](/how-to-plan-your-day-so-your-creativity-and-focus-will-flourish/) will help your team get to the deliverable before they burn out.

The key to understanding and enforcing these behaviors is how you query your users.

But planning and researching is only half of the battle - successfully executing a plan takes discipline, routine, and focus. I specialize in project planning that is data-driven and in touch with human emotions.

## **You can tell me who and what, and let me handle the how and when.**

The number one mistake most product managers make is measuring all time equally. And as a team's energy and resources fluctuate on a project, so does their emotional well-being and participation.

Traditional KPIs don't account for the obscure obstacles your individual contributors will run into, but my process of evaluating your project, organization, and tools will help your team make space for the extra questions that come up along the way.

Sometimes all a project needs is a well-designed spreadsheet to time deliverables - sometimes you need well-thought-out databases and 3rd party integrations.

Let's help your team plan around the unknown and develop systems that work realistically with your project goals, but also work with YOUR TEAM's method of working.
