# Documentation

## Learn how to integrate my workflow and enable instant support for your stakeholders

So, you've got some technical debt. You plan to do something about your documentation and support needs eventually butâ€¦ all too often, as priorities change, content that was supposed to be functional suddenly becomes an afterthought. These days, we can all relate to feeling too busy to write down every detail.

## It happens - I've been there

Your documentation goals might be different for customers, internal stakeholders, or 3rd party business leaders, but the process is always the same: to help your team extract their thoughts and experiences with whatever you're building then distill the need-to-know and hard-to-follow into a format that easily answers questions for future you.

You need someone who can work independently on a plan while equipped to provide updates before you need to ask. Someone who can quietly submerge their work with your team's processes and systems to help find what works (and what isn't helping) and who is willing to ask questions when things get challenging.

## This is where I come in

Think of a technical writer like a medic dropping in with life-support to your subject matter experts on the field. I bring aspects from team and product management solutions as well as from the perspective as a die-hard software user - that is why I'm willing to make an effort to develop a strategy for the reader: your users, your staff, and you.

For over 13 years, I've been fortunate enough to have worked both with enterprise and smaller startup customers on highly-technical projects.
