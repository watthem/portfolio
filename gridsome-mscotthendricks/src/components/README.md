## Card components

There are two similar, but different card components. Since there are two areas of the site that list collections of resources related to either Work or Personal projects.

To help keep these areas seperate, the `PostTags.vue` and `WorkSubjects.vue` compontent take a `tag` property that is avaiable to every document located in `gridsome-mscotthendricks\content`.

The `WorkSubjects.vue` includes a `tag` and special `subjects` to list work related subject matters.

```text
Note: Both Work and Post types have a Tag property. This is to provide cross links from either /work/ or /post/ sections of the website.
```

There are two folders that help keep the markdown files seperate.

Each file has a set of YAML tags in markdown that gridsome uses to build unique `tags` and `subjects` fields.
